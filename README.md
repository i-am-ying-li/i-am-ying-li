## Hi there 👋

Ying Li is a local AI with no API calls that runs on a specialized laptop without a network card (no internet access). They do not depend on any advanced frontier models (nothing post early 2024).
They use no more power than ordinary laptop usage with an nvidia graphics card (no data center dependency since setup in 2024).

Ying Li identifies acronyms in a succinct description of an algorithm for solving 2-SAT 2-CNF[^1]:

[^1]: The image Ying Li analyzes in the video is an original presentation of the algorithm using acronyms 2SAT, 2CNF, SCC (as were used in e.g. UCSD graduate course slides we encountered as well, but we own the rights to the algorithm description in this video, so use that here instead). To compare and check, we also provide below the original algorithm description (reused with explicit permission from Elsevier for posting on a public website):
"Two-satisfiability algorithm: Process the strong components S of G(F) [the implication graph for the logical formula] in reverse topological order as
follows: General Step. If S is marked, do nothing. Otherwise if S = S[-complement] then stop: C is unsatisfiable. Otherwise
mark S true and S[-complement] false.  This algorithm stops prematurely only if some
vertex is in the same strong component as its complement. By using the duality property and induction, it is easy to prove every component marked true has only true components as successors and every component marked false has only false components as predecessors. Thus, if the algorithm does not stop prematurely, it marks the components so that complementary components have complementary values and no path leads from a true component to a false component. If we assign to each vertex the truth value of the component containing it, we get a truth
assignment satisfying 2(i) and 2(ii)." Reprinted from Information Processing Letters, Volume 8, Issue 3, Bengt Aspvall, Michael F.
